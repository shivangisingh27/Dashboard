# Assessing trends in health and social indicators: A multi-round analysis of NFHS data in India

The NFHS stands for National Family Health Survey. It is a large-scale, multi-round survey conducted in a representative sample of households throughout India. The NFHS dataset encompasses all states and union territories of India. The project combines data from three rounds of the NFHS survey: NFHS-3 (2005-06), NFHS-4 (2015-16), and NFHS-5 (2019-21) to create a comprehensive dataset for analyzing and comparing the current state of health, demographics, and socio-economic factors in India.
We focused on 25-key important questions involving matters of healthcare, demographics and nutritional and life choices of the survey respondents. We have used the official website of  NFHS maintained by IIPS and data.gov.in to gather our data which made sure that the data was genuine and accurate.

We aim to analyze trends from three surveys spanning 2005 to 2019 and creating  insightful and interactive *Power BI dashboard* to present crucial demographic and health-related data for all states and union territories of India.This dashboard will serve as a powerful analytical tool for understanding and addressing key socio-economic challenges and opportunities across the entire nation.
